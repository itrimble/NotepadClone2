   - 🎹 Keyboard input
   - 🎯 First responder status
   - ⌨️ System-wide keyboard events

2. **Debug Areas**: 
   - `CustomTextView.swift` - Text view lifecycle and input handling
   - `AppDelegate.swift` - System keyboard monitoring
   - `DebugLogger.swift` - Centralized logging utility

3. **Known Issues**:
   - Text input may not work in some cases (debugging in progress)
   - If you can't type, check console logs for responder chain issues
