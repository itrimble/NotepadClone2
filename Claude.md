## Recent Updates (YYYY-MM-DD - Bugfixes, Integrations, Build Errors Resolved)

### Key Fixes & Integrations:
*   **Markdown Rendering:** Confirmed and integrated usage of the existing `Markdown` package in `MarkdownSplitView.swift` for proper HTML exports, replacing a temporary placeholder.
*   **Terminal Integration:** Successfully integrated Terminal components (`TerminalManager`, `TerminalView`, `TerminalPanelView`) into the main application flow; UI is now active.
*   **Core Functionality:** Resolved critical bugs related to typing (first responder, state flags), UI element visibility (tabs, file explorer), dual window opening, line number display, tab selection when opening files, and "Jump to Line" functionality.
*   **Theme System:** Added missing themes ("Aqua", "Turbo Pascal", "Mac OS 8") with placeholder styling for the latter two.
*   **Build Errors:** Fixed compilation errors in `FindInFilesManager.swift` (async iterator, unused variable) and initial errors in `MarkdownSplitView.swift` (theme property access, WebKit import).
*   **State Management:** Enhanced session state to include split view settings; added error logging for document state saving/loading.

* Split view uses HSplitView/VSplitView for proper macOS split pane behavior.
* Code folding uses enhanced NSRulerView (CodeFoldingRulerView) with interactive controls.
* Bracket matching uses NSLayoutManager temporary attributes for non-destructive highlighting.
* Markdown rendering uses Apple's `swift-markdown` package.

## Conversation History / TODO

* Phase 2.6 (Code Intelligence) has been completed
