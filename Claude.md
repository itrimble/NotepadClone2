* Split view uses HSplitView/VSplitView for proper macOS split pane behavior.
* Code folding uses enhanced NSRulerView (CodeFoldingRulerView) with interactive controls.
* Bracket matching uses NSLayoutManager temporary attributes for non-destructive highlighting.

## Conversation History / TODO

* Phase 2.6 (Code Intelligence) has been completed
* Phase 3 (File Explorer) has been completed - basic operations done, drag & drop and file watching remain
* Next phase: Document map/minimap implementation
