### Critical Bug Fixes (Session 2)
20. **Color Picker Issue:** ‚úÖ Fixed

* ~~Find in Files functionality~~ ‚úÖ Completed (UI integration needed)
* ~~Enhanced status bar~~ ‚úÖ Completed
* ~~Drag and drop file opening~~ ‚úÖ Completed
* ~~Code folding/unfolding~~ ‚úÖ Completed
* ~~Bracket matching~~ ‚úÖ Completed

## Additional Notes

* The application uses a mix of SwiftUI and AppKit components to provide advanced text editing capabilities.
* Window state restoration is important for preserving user sessions.
* Theme management supports System, Light, Dark, Notepad++, Material Dark, and Nord themes.
* Uses the NSWindowRestoration protocol for window state persistence.
* Built using Xcode version 16.3 (16E140).
* Line numbers are implemented using NSRulerView for native macOS integration.
* Split view uses HSplitView/VSplitView for proper macOS split pane behavior.
* Code folding uses enhanced NSRulerView (CodeFoldingRulerView) with interactive controls.
* Bracket matching uses NSLayoutManager temporary attributes for non-destructive highlighting.

## Conversation History / TODO
